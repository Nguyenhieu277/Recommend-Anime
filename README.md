# Overview

The "Recommend Anime" project is a recommendation system designed to help users find anime that match their interests and preferences. By analyzing natural language input, the system filters anime based on genres, minimum scores, and hobbies, delivering personalized suggestions. If no anime fits the query, it provides guidance to refine the search.



## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Features
- Natural Language Input: Accepts plain English queries (e.g., "I want romance and action anime with a score above 90").
- Genre Matching: Identifies anime genres from user input.
- Score Filtering: Filters recommendations based on minimum average score.
- Hobby-Based Mapping: Matches hobbies to related genres for broader recommendations.
- Fallback Responses: Informs users when no anime matches their criteria.
- Detailed Output: Provides titles, descriptions, genres, scores, and episode counts for each recommendation.
